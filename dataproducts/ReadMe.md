# Redshift Calibration with DESI


One core effort from the thesis work is the DESI Complete Calibration of the Color Redshift Relationship (DC3R2) effort. DC3R2 began as a spare fiber proposal that made use of existing 9-band (ugriZYJHKs) photometry in the KiDS-VIKING northern field to select by color. The result is a collection of galaxies that have sufficient photometric information to break most color-redshift degeneracies as well incredibly accurate DESI spectroscopic redshifts.
