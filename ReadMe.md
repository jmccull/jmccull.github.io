## Research
### Weak Lensing and the Calibration of the Color Redshift Relationship
Galaxies put out a lot of light, and that light tells us a great deal about the astrophysics inside that galaxy. Since the universe is rapidly expanding, we can also use the doppler shift in the light of a galaxy to measure its _redshift_, a proxy for distance. For mapping the matter distribution of our universe and the growth of structure over time, getting redshifts for galaxies with only a few pieces of color information is critical. Below you can see an example of the Dark Energy Survey _grizy_ filters (shaded) and how they might image a red elliptical galaxy that has stopped forming new stars. As the galaxy grows higher in redshift, _z_, you can see the light shifts to redder wavelengths and the sharp drop off in flux on the blue end of the spectrum (black line) can be seen passing through our five images from left to right. Since we know this drop off (the _balmer break_) happens at around 400 nm at rest, we can use our pictures to estimate the redshift and thus the distances to galaxies that look like this one. This is just one example of the color-redshift relation for a specific kind of galaxy. The full picture is much more complex!

If we can combine distance information with galaxy shapes, we can tease out distortions in light from large scale structure. Pictured on the left is a model of the effect massive galaxies have on background light. We can see the thickness of the lens acts as a proxy for the amount of matter, and that light is warped tangentially to the center of our galaxy proxy. Because this relies so heavily on distance and the geometry of the lens-background pair, good shape measurement and good distance estimators are crucial.

#### DESI
One core effort from my work is the DESI Complete Calibration of the Color Redshift Relationship (DC3R2, see the [astrobites summary](https://astrobites.org/2023/10/02/dc3r2/)). DC3R2 began as a spare fiber proposal that made use of existing 9-band (ugriZYJHKs) photometry in the KiDS-VIKING northern field to select by color. The result is a collection of galaxies that have sufficient photometric information to break most color-redshift degeneracies as well incredibly accurate DESI spectroscopic redshifts. In the figure below, on the left hand side you can see how DESI alone compares to the much smaller, but very well studied COSMOS field on the right. The limitation on redshift range comes from the optical nature of the DESI spectrograph, as you can see an example spectrum below losing spectral features in the DESI sensitivity range (unshaded) as it becomes more distant and highly redshifted. The common feature of the OII doublet is marked in blue.

#### 4MOST
As one of the PIs for the [4MOST Complete Calibration of the Color Redshift Relationship (4C3R2)](https://www.4most.eu/cms/science/extragalactic-community-surveys/) extragalactic survey, I aim to fill the spectroscopic color-space that galaxies visible to the future, ultra-deep lensing surveys will span. 4C3R2 aims to uniformly cover with high multiplicity the color space complementary to WAVES, as seen in the figure below.

(Right) The existing spectroscopy in the field, from preliminary DESI results and previous, sparser high-redshift searches in the COSMOS field.

### Shear Calibration and Shape Measurement
The Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DESY3) produced a novel shear calibration effort that examined how shear bias (our ability to understand how galaxies are sheared based upon their shapes) depends on galaxy-galaxy blending and redshift, or distance. See _(MacCrann et al 2022)_ [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.08567) for more information on how image simulations are used to more deeply understand photometric surveys and this [article](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/darchive/how-to-tease-out-the-tiniest-distortions-of-galaxy-shapes-to-probe-the-secrets-of-the-universe/) for a high level summary.
