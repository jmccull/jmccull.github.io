## Research
### Calibration of the Color Redshift Relationship
#### DESI
One core effort from the thesis work is the DESI Complete Calibration of the Color Redshift Relationship (DC3R2). DC3R2 began as a spare fiber proposal that made use of existing 9-band (ugriZYJHKs) photometry in the KiDS-VIKING northern field to select by color. The result is a collection of galaxies that have sufficient photometric information to break most color-redshift degeneracies as well incredibly accurate DESI spectroscopic redshifts. In the figure below, on the left hand side you can see how DESI alone compares to the much smaller, but very well studied COSMOS field on the right. The limitation on redshift range comes from the optical nature of the DESI spectrograph, as you can see an example spectrum below getting losing spectral features in the DESI sensitivity range as it becomes more distant and highly redshifted.

#### 4MOST
As one of the PIs for the [4MOST Complete Calibration of the Color Redshift Relationship (4C3R2)](https://www.4most.eu/cms/science/extragalactic-community-surveys/) extragalactic survey, much of the thesis work has been to fill the spectroscopic color-space that galaxies visible to the future, ultra-deep lensing surveys will span. 4C3R2 aims to uniformly cover with high multiplicity the color space complementary to WAVES, as seen in the figure below.

(Right) The existing spectroscopy in the field, from preliminary DESI results and previous, sparser high-redshift searches in the COSMOS field.


### Shear Calibration and Shape Measurement
The Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DESY3) produced a novel shear calibration effort that examined how shear bias (our ability to understand how galaxies are sheared based upon their shapes) depends on galaxy-galaxy blending and redshift. See _(MacCrann et al 2022)_ [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.08567) for more information on how image simulations are used to more deeply understand photometric surveys.
