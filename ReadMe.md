## About
Jamie is a doctoral student studying astrophysics and cosmology at Stanford and Ludwig Maximilians Universität München (LMU), with a speciality in heirarchical Bayesian methods, weak graviational lensing surveys, and photometric redshift calibration. She substantially contributed to the [Dark Energy Survey](https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/) Y3 Analysis and is an active member in the [Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)](https://www.desi.lbl.gov/), and the [4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST)](https://www.4most.eu/cms/) collaborations.

# Research
## Calibration of the Color Redshift Relationship
As one of the PIs for the [4MOST Complete Calibration of the Color Redshift Relationship (4C3R2)](https://www.4most.eu/cms/science/extragalactic-community-surveys/) extragalactic survey, there is tremendous interest in filling the spectroscopic color-space that galaxies visible to the future, ultra-deep lensing surveys will span.
